# COMPSCI 356 Computer Network Architecture: Lab 1 Echo Server

This lab is a warm-up for the following four labs. You are required to implement a simple echo server individually using socket API. An echo server can listen on a specific TCP port, and wait for a client to connect. After a TCP connection is established between the echo server and a client, the client can send arbitrary messages to the server and the server will echo back the same message to the client.
